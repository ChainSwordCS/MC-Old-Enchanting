<h2>History</h2>
<p>Enchanting was added in Minecraft Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3. At this some, experience was hard to come by, only available by killing mobs, and so high-level enchantments were difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>Howwever, enchantments in this early buggy state are still of interest. For example, in Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4 (hereafter stylized b1.9-p4), spawners, lit furnaces, infested stone block types, and smooth stone double slabs could be obtained with a silk touch pickaxe. In fact, the motivation behind this project was originally to find the optimal level for getting silk touch on an iron pickaxe.</p>
<p>The current scope of the project is now much broader: to document the mechanics of enchanting in these early days, to track any changes during the time from b1.9-p3 to 1.0.0, and to provide calculators to assist with any enchanting efforts for these versions.</p>

<h2>b1.9-p5</h2>
<p>We start with b1.9-p5 solely because a version of MCP was released for it. This and other historical MCP versions can be found on the <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Programs_and_editors/Mod_Coder_Pack">Minecraft Wiki</a>, and a direct download can be found <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?rf5tothc5h7au3f">here.</a></p>
